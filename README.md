# Led_control-C


This project controls five LEDs connected to the Arduino Uno board, making them light up one by one in sequence.

## Description

The program is written in C for the Arduino Uno. It initializes five digital pins (PD3, PD4, PD5, PD6, and PD7) as outputs and sequentially lights up each LED with a delay of 500 milliseconds. The hex file generated from this code was uploaded to the board using AVRDUDE.
